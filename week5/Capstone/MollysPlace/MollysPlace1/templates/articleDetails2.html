    While service dogs and therapy dogs have some similarities, there are vast differences between them. The greatest difference is that Therapy dogs, or Emotional Support Animals (ESA’s) are not required to be task trained. Remember, the difference between a task and a trick is that a task is something meant to aid the disabled person in their day-to-day life, and a trick is meant for entertainment. Neither ESA’s or Service Dogs are required to be registered with a national database at this time. It is recommended, however, that both service dogs and ESA’s go through canine good citizen, which is basic puppy into adulthood training. Another substantial difference between them is that: you only need a licensed therapist to write a letter for an ESA, while a service dog letter has to come from an MD. Typically, to have a service dog you have to have an obvious or well documented disability. To have an ESA, you only have to tell your therapist or doctor that the animal assists you with emotional regulation. Another difference is the level of accessibility. Service dogs are classified as “working dogs.” Under the ADA, State and local governments, business, and nonprofit organizations that serve the public generally must allow service animals to accompany people with disabilities in all areas of the facility where the public is allowed to go. (NWBB, 2021) In contrast ESA’s are not classed as “working dogs” and therefore can be denied entry, or even travel.
